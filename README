(this project is just getting started.  nothing to see here.  move along)

License

All the cruft you find here is public domain.  You don't have to credit
anyone to use this gunk, but my personal request is that you mention
Igor Pavlov for his hard, high quality work.

Project Goals

1. A tiny C wrapper around a subset of Igor Pavlov's public domain
   LZMA compression and decompression implementation.
2. A tiny and straighforward API
3. Encapsulate file header format in a manner that is forward compatible
   with better emergent standards
   (http://tukaani.org/lzma/header-format-12.txt)   
4. straight C command line utilites for the creation and extraction of lzma
   files that are compatible with the venerable LZMA utils library
   (http://tukaani.org/lzma/)
5. easy to build and use everywhere (doze and nix alike)
6. public domain licensing through and through.  (hats off to Igor)

XXX: write me (and the code)
